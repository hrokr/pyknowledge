## Puzzle description
    Shows a photo of a computer monitor with a tree background as a wallpaper
    2 to 38th power is in a box; there is a 0 at the top right of the monitor.

## Thoughts
    This is puzzle 0 or the first puzzle with index 0. 2**38 will be needed.
    12 digits probably isn't used in URL by itself (eg. 192.186.1.1) so let's
    just swap the number out with 0.


## Time
    start 1519 -- end 1522 (MPV)
    total time ==> approx. 3 min, no refactoring


## What I learned:
    Not much this was pretty easy.


## Where I would go next:
    exercise 1
