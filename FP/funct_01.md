# funct_01.py

## Task and Extra Credit (if any)
    Get some practice with functional programming.

## Time
    start 1500 -- end 1533 (MPV)

    total time ==> approx. 33 min, no refactoring

## What I learned:
    In Python2, map() returns a list; in Python3, it returns an iterator.

## Where I would go next:
    More practice!
