Averaging the Array <beta -- estimated at 8 kyu>

Comments:
    I set this as kyu 8 as it was super simple

Task:
    Define a function that finds the average of all the numbers in the array given.
    Remember, the output will only be a float if one of the numbers being used to
    compute it is also a float.

    return sum(arr)/len(arr)
    


Input >> Output Examples
    listAvg([6,12,36,30]) # => 21.0
    listAvg([12,6,9,4,3,7]) # => 6.833333333333333
