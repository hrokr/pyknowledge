## Task and Extra Credit (if any)

    Validate a telephone number, as if written on an input form.
    Telephone numbers can be written as ten digits, with dashes, spaces, dots
    between the three segments, or with the area code parenthesized
    Both the area code and any white space between segments are optional.

    Examples --  all of the following are valid telephone numbers: 1234567890,
    123-456-7890, 123.456.7890, (123)456-7890, (123) 456-7890 (note the whitespace
    following the area code), and 456-7890.

    The following are not valid telephone numbers: 123-45-6789, 123:4567890,
    and 123/456-7890. source: programmingpraxis.com
