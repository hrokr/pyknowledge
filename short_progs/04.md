# Challenge 04
## Task and Extra Credit (if any)

    Write a program that will print the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall".
    Extra credit: do not allow the program to print each loop on a new line.


## Time
     start 1538 -- end 1543 (MPV)
     start 1543 -- 1600 (added in )

     total time ==> approx. 22 min, including refactoring as a function and printing changes.



## What I learned:
    This was a pretty easy assignment; much more so that some of the other ones
    which are also classified as easy.

    The extra credit part required the use of end = ' ' was interesting.

    Probably the most useful part was making the thing a function. I found
    [this] (http://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch05.html) to be useful.

## Where I would go next:
    Nothing.
