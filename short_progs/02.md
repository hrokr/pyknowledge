## Task and Extra Credit (if any)

    Write a program that can encrypt texts with an alphabetical caesar cipher (simple rotation). This cipher can ignore numbers, symbols, and whitespace.


    Optionally, add a "decrypt" function to your program!

## Time
     start 1440 -- end 1456 (MPV) using encode()
     start 1456 -- end 1549 refactored to allow for any offset

     total time ==> approx.  min.

     Additional time spent refactoring that added in the extra credit part.

## What I learned:

## Where I would go next:
    This doesn't have a way of dealing wth
