# Challenge 06
## Task and Extra Credit (if any)
    The user to input digits; the program arranges them in numerical order.
    extra credit -- have it also arrange strings in alphabetical order.


## Time
    start  -- end  (MPV)
    start  --  (added in )

    total time ==> approx. 22 min, including refactoring



## What I learned:
    Finally figured out how to push from git to github rather than upload via
    the web interface. It didn't show the activity on the contribution page
    though which is problematic, however, the site says it can take up to 24
    hrs to update.


## Where I would go next:
