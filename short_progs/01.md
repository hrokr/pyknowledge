# Challenge 01
## Task and Extra Credit (if any)
    Prompt for name, age, and reddit username.

    Output: "your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)"

    Optionally, have the program log this information to a file.
## Time
     start 14:30 -- end 14:50
     start 23:45 -- end 11:52 (MVP)
     total time ==> approx. 27 min.
     Additional time spent refactoring that added in the extra credit part.
## What I learned:
    Inserting \n at the end of a line.

    Beginnings of TDD - I naturally work with short cycles but this seems to be something to push towards particularly with writing actual tests.

    Getting the output to work 'a'
