# Challenge 03
## Task and Extra Credit (if any)

    Create a random password generator
    Allow the user to specify the amount of passwords to generate.
    Extra credit: allow user to specify the length of the strings generated



## Time
     start 2113 -- end 2121 (MPV) using encode()
     start 49 refactored to allow for any offset

     total time ==> approx.  min.

     Additional time spent refactoring that added in the extra credit part.

## What I learned:
    About the [**random**method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
    NameError -- I needed to put the options ahead of the part that took the
        option in. Thanks StackOverflow!
    Lookups. I had defined the options (e.g., n = '1234567890') and could print
    n, the literal 'n' to the screen but getting it to display as 1-0 was ...
    problematic


## Where I would go next:
