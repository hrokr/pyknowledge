## What's this all about?

I'm interested in learning Python. It's not because I'm married to it but
because there are a lot of resources for it and the language (as well as it's
ecosystem) seems to moving slowly enough it's possible to get a grip on it as
opposed to JavaScript. As a first language, I think actually learning a language
-- any language -- to fluency is key.

More specifically, I'm interested in the following areas:

    Machiene Learning / Deep Learning / Artificial Inteligence
    Modeling Data
    Functional Programming

At least initially this going to be broken down into the following sections:

1. PyChal       - Exercises from [Python Challenge] (http://www.pythonchallenge.com)
2. short_progs  - Some of Reddit's coding [daily
   programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges)
3. FP           - Practice in Functional Programming basics (map, recursion, lambda)
