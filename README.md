## What's this all about?

I'm interested in learning Python because it seems to changing slowly enough to get a grip on it -- as opposed to JavaScript where things seem to change from week to week. Since I'm basically a beginner, I'm more interested in gaining real fluency with a language rather than any particular language. The fluency is key as from there I can map the concepts to other languages.

More specifically, I'm interested in the following areas:

    Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Artificial Intelligence
    Modeling Data
    Functional Programming
    Test Driven Design

At least initially this going to be broken down into the following sections:

1. PyChal       - Exercises from [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com)
2. Short_progs  - Some of Reddit's coding [daily
   programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges)
3. Self-directed projects
