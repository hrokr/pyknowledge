## What's this?

I need a place to keep track of what I'm learning. That's true for new concepts but also for litte tricks and bits of code that I like.

I'm in the process of reorganizing but this is what I'm thinking will work for now.

1. MOOCS - This may become videos and books -- but MOOCs is good for now.

2. Practice code - There are a ton of sites like [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com), [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and Reddit's [daily programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges). I could use some organization

3. Self-directed cookbook projects like those from [Talk Python To Me](https://training.talkpython.fm/)
