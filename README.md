## What's this all about?

I'm interested in learning Python not because I think its a perfect language
but because there are a lot of resources for it and Python seems to changing
slowly enough to get a grip on it as opposed to JavaScript. As a first
language, I think actually learning a language -- any language -- to fluency is
key. From there I can map the concepts to other languages.

More specifically, I'm interested in the following areas:

    Machiene Learning / Deep Learning / Artificial Inteligence
    Modeling Data
    Functional Programming
    Test Driven Design

At least initially this going to be broken down into the following sections:

1. PyChal       - Exercises from [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com)
2. short_progs  - Some of Reddit's coding [daily
   programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges)
3. FP           - Practice in Functional Programming basics (map, recursion, lambda)
